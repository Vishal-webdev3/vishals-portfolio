      <p>
        Iâ€™m Vishal, a frontend developer with a strong foundation in React.js and a focus on clean, responsive UI development. With a self-driven transition from operations into development, I've built multiple real-world web applications using modern JavaScript, API integration, and reusable component design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience spans working with mock clients, live deployment using GitHub Pages & Netlify, and contributing to client-ready tools across different domains. I enjoy transforming ideas into practical digital interfaces that are fast, scalable, and user-focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m confident in tools like React Router, state management, form handling, and chart visualization. I approach every project with attention to detail, clear logic, and adaptability to evolving requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently open to frontend roles where I can continue to grow and contribute to meaningful development teams.
